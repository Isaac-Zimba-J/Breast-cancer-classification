# Breast Cancer Image Segmentation and Classification

![Project Logo/Icon]

## Overview

This project aims to facilitate the segmentation and classification of breast cancer ultrasound images. It began as an extension of code initially developed by [Khaled Hushme](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaledhoshme) on Kaggle. Our project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for image segmentation, Gabor feature extraction, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Please note that the classification component is currently a work in progress and is actively being improved.

## Features

- **Ultrasound Image Segmentation:** The GUI enables users to upload and process ultrasound images, perform segmentation to isolate regions of interest (ROIs), and generate masks for further analysis.

- **Gabor Feature Extraction:** We have incorporated Gabor feature extraction to capture texture and structural information from the segmented ultrasound images. These features can be used for subsequent classification tasks.

- **Image Classification:** While the classification model's performance is currently being enhanced, it serves as a foundational framework for future improvements and research endeavors.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Isaac-Zimba-J/Breast-cancer-classification.git
    ```

2. **Dependencies:** Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. This includes Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other relevant packages. You can find a list of dependencies in the project's documentation.

3. **Usage:** Execute the GUI application to segment images, create masks, and apply Gabor feature extraction. These features can then be used in the classification process using the provided CNN model (Note: Improvements to the classification model are ongoing).

4. **Contributions:** If you are interested in contributing to this project, please refer to our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Project Structure

- **/src**: This directory contains the source code for the GUI application, image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification components.

- **/data**: Store your ultrasound images and datasets in this directory.

- **/models**: Save pre-trained or trained CNN models here.

- **/results**: This directory is intended for storing segmentation masks, feature vectors, and classification results.

## Future Enhancements

- Enhance the performance of the image classification model by refining the CNN architecture and optimizing hyperparameters.

- Improve the user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

- Expand documentation, provide usage examples, and offer tutorials to assist users and contributors.
